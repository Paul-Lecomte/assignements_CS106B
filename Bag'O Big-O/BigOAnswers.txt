# Big-O Analysis Answers (Problem 1)
# ----------------------------------
# Write the big-O *time* complexities for each function you analyze.
# If you're following the original CS106B A5, list the function name and its runtime.
# Example format:
#
# Printing Chip / drawN:          O(n^2)
# Counting Triples / countTriples: O(n^3)
# Printing Cycles / rotateA:      O(n^2)
# Printing Cycles / rotateB:      O(n)
# Recursive Mysteries / riddle1:  O(2^n)
# Max Single-Sell Profit / brute: O(n^2)
# Max Single-Sell Profit / linear: O(n)
#
# Feel free to add your own functions to the timing harness in src/main.cpp if helpful.
